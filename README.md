# GRIP_TASK_1
## Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning

### About this Notebook
In this notebook, we learn how to use scikit-learn to implement linear regression. We used a dataset that is related to number of hours studied and percentage of marks scored. Then, we split our data into training and test sets, create a model using training set, evaluate our model using test set, and finally use model to predict unknown value for hours=9.25
